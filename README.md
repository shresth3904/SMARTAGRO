# SmartAgro: Smart Irrigation for Hilly Regions

### PS Chosen: SIH Hackathon (ID: ID25062)

This README provides an overview of the **SmartAgro** project, a sensor-based smart irrigation system developed for the Smart India Hackathon. It includes team details, relevant links, key features, the technology stack, and steps to run the project locally.

The project directly addresses the problem statement **"Implementation of Smart Agriculture for Efficient Cultivation in Hilly Regions"** by providing an affordable, automated irrigation solution tailored to conserve water and improve crop yields in water-scarce areas like Jorethang, South Sikkim.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### User & System Management
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
* **Device Registration:** A one-time setup process to link a user account with a unique hardware device ID and code.
* **Personalized Dashboard:** Each user has a dedicated dashboard displaying data only from their registered device.

### Intelligent Irrigation Control
* **Dual Operation Modes:**
    * **AUTO Mode:** A fully automated, intelligent logic that controls the pump based on multiple factors.
    * **MANUAL Mode:** Allows the user to toggle the pump ON/OFF directly from the dashboard.
* **Crop Intelligence:** Irrigation thresholds are dynamically set based on the selected crop and its current growth stage from a pre-defined database schedule.
* **Weather Integration:** The system fetches real-time weather data. In AUTO mode, it automatically disables irrigation if there is a high probability of rain, conserving water.
* **Resource Management:** Monitors the water tank level and prevents the pump from running dry, protecting the hardware.
* **Time-Based Scheduling:** Users can define specific time windows (e.g., 06:00 to 18:00) during which the irrigation system is permitted to operate.

### Monitoring & Visualization
* **Real-time Sensor Data:** The dashboard displays live data for soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, and water tank level.
* **Interactive Charts:** Historical data for each sensor is plotted on graphs to visualize trends over time.
* **Intuitive UI:** Custom-designed UI elements like gauges, bars, and thermometers provide an at-a-glance understanding of the current farm conditions.
* **System Notifications:** The system sends critical alerts and status updates (e.g., "Pump ON," "Water level low") to the user's Telegram.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install Flask Flask-Login Werkzeug requests
    ```
    *(You can also create a `requirements.txt` file with these packages and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Set Up API Keys**
    In the `app.py` file, replace the placeholder values for the following variables with your actual keys:
    ```python
    # Line 19
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_strong_secret_key'

    # Line 21
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"

    # Line 301
    API_KEY = 'YOUR_WEATHERAPI_COM_KEY'
    ```

5.  **Initialize the Database**
    The application automatically creates the `database.db` file and the necessary tables when it first runs. However, you will need to manually add data to the `irrigation_schedule` and `device` tables for the system to function correctly.

    You can use a tool like **DB Browser for SQLite** to create and populate these tables.

6.  **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
