## ‚ú® Key Features

### User & System Management
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
* **Device Registration:** A one-time setup process to link a user account with a unique hardware device ID and code.
* **Personalized Dashboard:** Each user has a dedicated dashboard displaying data only from their registered device.

### Intelligent Irrigation Control
* **Dual Operation Modes:**
    * **AUTO Mode:** A fully automated, intelligent logic that controls the pump based on multiple factors.
    * **MANUAL Mode:** Allows the user to toggle the pump ON/OFF directly from the dashboard.
* **Crop Intelligence:** Irrigation thresholds are dynamically set based on the selected crop and its current growth stage from a pre-defined database schedule.
* **Weather Integration:** The system fetches real-time weather data. In AUTO mode, it automatically disables irrigation if there is a high probability of rain, conserving water.
* **Resource Management:** Monitors the water tank level and prevents the pump from running dry, protecting the hardware.
* **Time-Based Scheduling:** Users can define specific time windows (e.g., 06:00 to 18:00) during which the irrigation system is permitted to operate.

### Monitoring & Visualization
* **Real-time Sensor Data:** The dashboard displays live data for soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, and water tank level.
* **Interactive Charts:** Historical data for each sensor is plotted on graphs to visualize trends over time.
* **Intuitive UI:** Custom-designed UI elements like gauges, bars, and thermometers provide an at-a-glance understanding of the current farm conditions.
* **System Notifications:** The system sends critical alerts and status updates (e.g., "Pump ON," "Water level low") to the user's Telegram.

## Local Setup Instructions (Write for both windows and macos)

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shresth3904/SMARTAGRO.git
    cd SMARTAGRO/code/software
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Required Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys and Secret Key**

    Open the `app.py` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual keys:

    ```python
    # Line 14
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_strong_secret_key'

    # Line 16
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    BOT_NAME = "YOUR_BOT_NAME"

    # Line 205
    API_KEY = 'YOUR_WEATHERAPI_COM_KEY'
    ```

[Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial)

5.  **Run the Flask Application**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will now be running and accessible at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
